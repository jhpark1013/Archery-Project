Archers are becoming increasing proficient at hitting standard targets in a standard manner. 
I came up with a new archery competition that is set up like a normal targeting range but with the objective to have the arrow hit the target at the steepest angle possible. 
Now, future competitors have to know the optimal speed and angle to achieve the best possible final angle while still hitting the target. 
In order to determine the best way for competitors to win, I constructed an unconstrained rigid body model of an arrow’s flight, taking into account gravity, drag, and lift. 
I confirmed this model through physical considerations, and then used it to determine which cases give the best result.
